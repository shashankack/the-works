          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>
            Rooted in the century-old legacy of The Nilgiris 1905, The Works is
            a space built on tradition, perseverance, and community. Evolving
            through four generations, it is now a vibrant hub where movement,
            creativity, and connection come together. We believe in giving back
            creating an inclusive, inspiring space for exploration,
            collaboration, and self-growth. Whether through fitness, artistic
            expression, or shared experiences, The Works is a place to move,
            create, and thrive.

              <p>
                Raghuram, a dedicated martial artist specializing in kickboxing
                and Muay Thai, has created a private gym where individuals build
                confidence, strength, and discipline. Inspired by his family's
                century-old business, he expanded his vision beyond martial arts
                to establish The Worksâ€”a multi-purpose community space. More
                than a gym, The Works is a hub for fitness and creative
                expression, where people can explore art, connect, and grow.
                Raghuram believes in the transformative power of both physical
                and artistic practices, fostering a supportive environment that
                encourages self-expression, collaboration, and personal
                development. His mission is to empower individuals through
                movement and creativity.
